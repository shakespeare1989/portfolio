            <p>Let me tell you a little bit about myself: I am a hard worker, determined, and love to live a positive life. I currently study Full Stack Web Development (Python+React) at Bottega Coding School and anticipate graduating soon. I am a self trained IT Professional, with my CompTIA A+ certification and currently studying towards my CompTIA Network+ Certification. With over three years of IT related experience, I am capable of problem solving and self study, thus assisting in creating long lasting customer relationships and efficient offices; which is how I would exceed expectations at your company.
 
 I am also a very fun, upbeat, perky young woman that can add to a positive environment and put a smile on anyoneâ€™s face. I feel I would be a great asset to your company.
